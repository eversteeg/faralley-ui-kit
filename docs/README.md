## Interesting reads

Airbnb is famous for many things and one of those things are their extended code style guides. I would advice every developer who is working with JavaScript and/or React to read them. If you're going to work on this project please check them out since a lot of code in this project is following the patterns mentioned in these guides:

- [Airbnb React style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)
